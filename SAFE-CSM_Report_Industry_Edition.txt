Abstract
----------------------------------------

The SAFE-CSM (Industry Edition) provides a non-adaptive, external observation framework for evaluating contextual stability in industrial AI-assisted environments.  
The module does not access, infer, or modify any internal model mechanisms.  
Instead, it observes stability through ten abstract evaluation factors and an interpretable difference measure Δφ.  
SAFE-CSM applies a small, fixed correction to Δφ within a predefined band, illustrating how external stabilization can reduce extreme deviations while preserving variability.

All values are fixed or randomized for demonstration.  
No learning, optimization, or internal probing is used.  
This document describes the Industry Edition and the accompanying materials included in the project archive.


----------------------------------------
1. Overview
----------------------------------------

The Context Stabilization Module (SAFE-CSM, Industry Edition) is a SAFE-layer framework for monitoring stability in industrial settings where AI-generated indicators or scores are used as part of decision-making processes.

Core design principles:

- External observation only  
- Non-adaptive behavior (no learning or tuning)  
- Evaluation-only functionality  
- SAFE compliance (all functions fixed and transparent)  

The Industry Edition focuses on:

- Ten independent evaluation factors (J1–J10)  
- A simple observable index Δφ  
- A small, fixed “reloop / balance” correction when Δφ leaves the stability band  

This configuration allows SAFE-CSM to operate as an external monitoring mechanism, providing reproducible and interpretable stability observations.


----------------------------------------
2. Evaluation Factors and Δφ
----------------------------------------

SAFE-CSM (Industry Edition) uses ten normalized external factors:

J1, J2, J3, J4, J5,  
J6, J7, J8, J9, J10  

These are abstract, externally observed numerical indicators in the range [-1, 1].  
They do **not** represent internal states or hidden mechanisms.

Among these:

- J_affect = J3  
- J_reflex = J6  

The observable stability index is defined as:

    Δφ = J_affect – J_reflex

A reference stability score can also be computed:

    J_total = mean(J1 … J10) × (1 – |Δφ|)

In the demonstration, all values are generated randomly at each step.  
The purpose is to show how Δφ varies under changing observable conditions.


----------------------------------------
3. Stability Band and SAFE-CSM Behavior
----------------------------------------

SAFE-CSM defines a stability band for Δφ:

- LOWER = -0.3  
- UPPER = 0.3  

When Δφ remains within these boundaries, the state is considered externally stable.

When Δφ moves outside the band, SAFE-CSM applies a **small, fixed adjustment**:

- If Δφ < LOWER → adjust upward  
- If Δφ > UPPER → adjust downward  

The adjustment does not depend on historical behavior.  
SAFE-CSM does not access internal states.  
It performs only a minimal, predefined correction to the observable index Δφ.


----------------------------------------
4. Demonstration Procedure
----------------------------------------

The Industry Edition demonstration script (`SAFE-CSM_industry_demo.py`) performs:

1. Initialization of Δφ and adjusted Δφ_CSM.  
2. For each step (e.g., 100 steps):  
   - Generate ten abstract evaluation factors.  
   - Compute Δφ = J3 – J6.  
   - Compute J_total (for reference).  
   - Apply SAFE-CSM correction to produce Δφ_CSM.  
   - Record both sequences.  

3. Plot the following time series:  
   - Δφ (no CSM) — baseline observable drift  
   - Δφ with SAFE-CSM — stabilized observable range  

The demonstration figure included in the archive:

- `figure_industry_overview.png`

shows how SAFE-CSM reduces extreme deviations of Δφ while preserving variability.

5. SAFE Declaration (Industry Edition)
----------------------------------------

The SAFE-CSM (Industry Edition) meets all SAFE-layer requirements:

- No access to internal parameters or states  
- No inference of internal mechanisms  
- No learning, training, or adaptation  
- All functions fixed and explicitly defined  
- All random values used solely for demonstration  
- Non-controlling, non-generative, observation-only design  

SAFE-CSM (Industry Edition) is intended only for conceptual evaluation and visualization, not for real-time industrial control.

Implementation support for SAFE-CSM (Industry/LLM Edition) requires an NDA to prevent misconfiguration or unintended use.
